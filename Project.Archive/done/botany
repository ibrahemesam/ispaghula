seeds are planted November
fruits are collected in March/April
Though it is not affected by pests or disease,
the yield is decreased gratly due to heavy rainfall or storms

seeds contain about 10% mucilage (in epidermis of testa).

$ Mucilage consists of two complex polysaccharides:
= Pentosan:-
    - soluble in cold water
    - on hydrolysis yields xylose and arabinose
= aldobionic acid:-
    - the other soluble in hot water
    - on hydrolysis: yields galactouronic acid and rhamnose

Chemical Tests:-
1.Ispaghula seeds when treated with ruthenium red give red colour due to the presence of mucilage.
2.Add water to few seeds on a slide, mucilage comes out and  forms zone surrounding the seeds.
3.Swelling factor: Swelling factor is the parameter to determine the purity of seeds (10â€“13).

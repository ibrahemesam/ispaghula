It has been observed that there is a positive association
with plasma LDL cholesterol levels and coronary heart
disease risk.

Intake of dietary fibers known to lower the
concentration of LDL in plasma is considered to be highly
beneficial.

Psyllium intake has consistently shown
significant reductions in plasma LDL cholesterol levels
ranging from 10 to 24%.

Reports of the use of psyllium,
largely in hypercholesterolemia men, have suggested that
it lowers serum cholesterol as a result of the binding of
bile acids in the intestinal lumen and reduced risk of
coronary heart disease.

The mechanism of action of
psylliumâ€™s hypercholesterolemia effects has not been fully
elucidated.

Psyllium was shown to stimulate bile acid
synthesis by increasing the hydroxylase activity in animal
and humans models.

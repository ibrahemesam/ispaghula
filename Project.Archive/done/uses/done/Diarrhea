Normal intestine delivers stools that defer widely in quantity but maintain percent fecal water within a narrower range.
Stools looseness in diarrhea is determined by the ratio of fecal water too water holding capacity of insoluble solids.

Fecal consistency was markedly different in psyllium calves as compare with control.

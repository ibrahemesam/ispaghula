Ispagula was found stable in the stomach pH (acidic) than intestinal pH (alkaline) due to comparatively rapid swelling in alkaline pH than acidic pH.
In the intestinal environment, where the concentration of monovalent ions (e.g., Na+, K+) is higher and exceeds the concentration of multivalent metal cations (e.g., Ca2+, Al3+). Therefore, these ionotropic-gels tend to lose their stability over the term due to diffusion leading to exchange of multivalent metal cations for monovalent ones, which results faster and premature release of encapsulated drugs from ionotropically-gelled GG particulates in intestinal pH.
Hydrogels, specially based on polysaccharides, are excellent controlled release devices or targetable devices of the therapeutic agents.
The release rate of drugs from hydrogels was primarily determined by the swelling extent, which further enhanced by addition of enzyme in the buffer solutions.
The loading of a drug onto hydrogels matrix was carried out by swelling equilibrium method.
The hydrogel was allowed to swell in the drug solution of known concentration for 24 h at 37C and then dried to obtain the release device.
The concentration of the rejected solution was measured to calculate percent entrapment of the drug in the polymer matrix.

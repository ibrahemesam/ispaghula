Ispaghula has mucilage higher than other Plantago species.
it is capable of absorbing up to 40 times its own weight in water.
it consists 85 % water-soluble fiber, it is partly fermentable (invitro 72 % unfermentable residue) and acts by hydration in the bowel.

The pharmacological effects is  mechanical stimulation of the gut wall depending on the increase in intestinal bulk by water and the decrease in viscosity of the luminal contents.

When taken with a sufficient amount of liquid (at
least 30 ml per 1 g of herbal substance), it produces an increased volume of intestinal contents due to its highly bulking properties and hence a stretch stimulus which triggers defaecation.

At the same time the swollen mass of mucilage forms a lubricating layer which makes the transit of intestinal contents easier.
In mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia a reduction of serum cholesterol of approximately 5 % is reported in literature.
